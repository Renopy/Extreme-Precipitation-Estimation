# Extreme Precipitation Estimation Using Satellite Datasets

Welcome to the Extreme Precipitation Estimation repository! This project is dedicated to improving the estimation and prediction of extreme precipitation events through the use of satellite datasets and advanced data analysis techniques. Our goal is to provide accurate and timely information that can aid in weather forecasting, disaster management, and climate research.

Project Overview:
Extreme precipitation events, such as heavy rainfall and snowstorms, can have significant impacts on communities and ecosystems. Traditional ground-based measurement techniques are often limited in spatial coverage and resolution. By integrating satellite datasets, we can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of these events on a global scale.

##Key Components:
Satellite Data Integration:

Utilises datasets from satellites such as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).
Processes high-resolution data to capture precipitation patterns over large areas.
Machine Learning Models:

Employs machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
Trains models on historical data to identify patterns and predict future events.
Data Visualisation:

Provides interactive visualisation tools to explore precipitation data and model outputs.
Utilises libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating detailed and informative plots.
Case Studies and Applications:

Includes case studies demonstrating the application of our models in real-world scenarios.
Showcases the potential for disaster preparedness and response planning.
