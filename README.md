# Extreme Precipitation Estimation Using Satellite Datasets

Welcome to the Extreme Precipitation Estimation repository! 
This project is the first step dedicated to improving the estimation and prediction of extreme precipitation events through the use of satellite datasets and advanced data analysis techniques. Our goal is to provide accurate and timely information that can aid in weather forecasting, disaster management, and climate research.

Project Overview:
Extreme precipitation events, such as heavy rainfall and snowstorms, can have significant impacts on communities and ecosystems. Traditional ground-based measurement techniques are often limited in spatial coverage and resolution. By integrating satellite datasets, we can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of these events on a global scale.

# Datasets:
1. GHCN Observation (Global Historical Climatology Network): A comprehensive dataset containing historical climate data from global weather stations, including temperature and precipitation, used for climate research and trend analysis.

2. GPM-IMERG (Global Precipitation Measurement - Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM): Provides high-resolution global precipitation estimates by combining observations from multiple satellites, essential for studying precipitation patterns and climate change.

3. ECMWF Fifth Generation Reanalysis (ERA5): A detailed reanalysis dataset from ECMWF offering hourly estimates of various climate variables, combining model data and observations, widely used in meteorology and climatology research.

4. PDIR (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks - Climate Data Record): Offers precipitation estimates derived from satellite observations using neural networks, providing consistent long-term data for climate monitoring and hydrological applications.




# Machine Learning Models:
  Employs machine learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks, and Deep Learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
1. ANN (Artificial Neural Network): ANNs are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected neurons organized in layers (input, hidden, and output). Each neuron processes input data using weighted connections and activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. ANNs are used in various applications like image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting due to their ability to model non-linear relationships.

2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): CNNs are a type of deep learning network designed for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically detect spatial hierarchies of features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for final classification. CNNs excel in image and video recognition tasks, medical image analysis, and some natural language processing applications due to their ability to capture spatial dependencies.

3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. They use memory cells and gating mechanisms (input, forget, and output gates) to control information flow, making them suitable for tasks requiring context over long sequences. LSTMs are commonly used in time series forecasting, speech recognition, and natural language processing tasks like language translation.

4. RF (Random Forest): Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees using random subsets of data and features. The final prediction is made by aggregating the outputs of all trees (majority voting for classification or averaging for regression). This method reduces overfitting and improves accuracy, making it useful in applications like medical diagnosis, customer segmentation, and fraud detection.

5. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): ACO is an optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behaviour of ants, which deposit pheromones on paths to signal favourable routes. In ACO, artificial ants build solutions by traversing a graph and depositing virtual pheromones, iteratively improving solutions by reinforcing the best paths. It is used for solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as the travelling salesman problem, network routing, and scheduling.
